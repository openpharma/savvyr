Description: The SAVVY project is a consortium of academic and pharmaceutical
    industry partners that aims to improve the analyses of adverse event (AE)
    data in clinical trials through the use of survival techniques appropriately
    dealing with varying follow-up times and competing events, see 
    Stegherr, Schmoor, Beyersmann, et al. (2021) <doi:10.1186/s13063-021-05354-x>. 
    Although statistical methodologies have advanced, 
    in AE analyses often the incidence proportion, the incidence density or a 
    non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator are used, which either ignore censoring or
    competing events. This package contains functions to easily conduct the
    proposed improved AE analyses.
