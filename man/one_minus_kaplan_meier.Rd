\title{One Minus Kaplan-Meier}
\usage{
one_minus_kaplan_meier(data, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(\code{data.frame})\cr with columns including
\itemize{
\item \code{time_to_event}: Time to the first AE, death or soft competing event.
\item \code{type_of_event}: 0 for censored, 1 for AE, 2 for death, 3 for soft competing event.
}}

\item{tau}{(\code{number})\cr milestone at which One Minus Kaplan-Meier is computed.}
}
\value{
(\code{vector})\cr with the following entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{ae_prob}: Estimated probability of AE.
\item \code{ae_prob_var}: Variance of that estimate.
}
}
\description{
This funciton calculates the one minus Kaplan-Meier estimator of adverse events (while censoring all competing events)
observed in \verb{[0, tau]}.
Please also refer to formula (4) in
