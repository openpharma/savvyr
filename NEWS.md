# savvyr 0.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- Changed the way data is generated in function 'generate_data': The variable 'type_event' is now generated such that it accurately reflects the specified hazards for AE, death and soft competing events.
  
# savvyr 0.1.0

- First CRAN version of the package.
- The package provides functions to easily conduct the improved AE analyses proposed by the SAVVY framework.

### New Features

- Estimators that do not account for competing events (incidence proportion, incidence density, Inverse Kaplan Meier).
- Estimators accounting for competing events (incidence proportion accounting for competing events and Aalen-Johansen, both first with death only as hard competing event, or using all competing events).
